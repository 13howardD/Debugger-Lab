## Markdown Example for Debugger Lab Answers

**Question 1:** The double asterisks surrounding "Question 1:" cause the text
to be bold. Using single asterisks would result in *italics*. For your actual
answer to Question 1 you will be discussing the variable `cutoff`. When you put
the name of a variable, method, class, etc. into a Markdown file, you should
surround it in backticks so it appears in a different font. You can also insert
a block of code by surrounding it by two sets of three backticks, like this:

```
String example = "Example";
System.out.println(example);
```

**Question 2:** Separating each answer with a blank line causes each answer to
be its own paragraph.
You
could
write
each
word
on
a
separate
line
if
you
really
wanted
to
and
it
would
still
appear
as
one
paragraph
as
long
as
there
are
no
empty
lines.
